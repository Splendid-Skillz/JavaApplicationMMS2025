1. abstract — Used to declare a class or method that cannot be instantiated or must be overridden in subclasses.  
2. assert — Used for debugging; checks if a condition is true and throws an AssertionError if false.  
3. boolean — Primitive data type that can hold only true or false values.  
4. break — Immediately exits the nearest enclosing loop or switch statement.  
5. byte — Primitive data type for 8-bit signed integers (-128 to 127).  
6. case — Defines a value label inside a switch statement.  
7. catch — Defines a block to handle a specific type of exception thrown in a try block.  
8. char — Primitive data type for a single 16-bit Unicode character.  
9. class — Used to declare a class (the blueprint for creating objects).  
10. const — Reserved keyword (not used in Java; final is used for constants instead).  
11. continue — Skips the rest of the current loop iteration and proceeds to the next one.  
12. default — Specifies the default case in a switch, or default method in an interface, or default access level.  
13. do — Starts a do-while loop that executes the body at least once before checking the condition.  
14. double — Primitive data type for 64-bit floating-point numbers with double precision.  
15. else — Executes a block when the if condition is false.  
16. enum — Declares an enumerated type (a fixed set of named constants).  
17. export — Used in module declarations (Java 9+)
18. extends — Indicates that a class inherits from another class or an interface extends another interface.
19. final — Prevents a variable from being reassigned, a method from being overridden, or a class from being subclassed.  
20. finally — Defines a block that always executes after a try-catch, regardless of whether an exception occurred.  
21. float — Primitive data type for 32-bit floating-point numbers.  
22. for — Used to create a traditional for loop with initialization, condition, and update expressions.  
23. goto — Reserved keyword (not used in Java; jumps are avoided in favor of structured control flow).  
24. if — Executes a block of code only if a condition evaluates to true.  
25. implements — Indicates that a class provides implementations for all methods of one or more interfaces.  
26. import — Brings classes or entire packages into the current file’s namespace.  
27. instanceof — Tests whether an object is an instance of a specific class, interface, or subtype.  
28. int — Primitive data type for 32-bit signed integers.  
29. interface — Declares a contract of methods that implementing classes must provide.  
30. long — Primitive data type for 64-bit signed integers.  
31. native — Indicates that a method is implemented in platform-dependent code (usually C/C++).  
32. new — Creates a new instance of a class or array.  
33. package — Declares the package (namespace) that the current source file belongs to.  
34. private — Access modifier that makes a member visible only within the same class.  
35. protected — Access modifier that makes a member visible within the same package and in subclasses.  
36. public — Access modifier that makes a member visible from everywhere.  
37. return — Exits a method and optionally returns a value to the caller.  
38. short — Primitive data type for 16-bit signed integers.  
39. static — Makes a member belong to the class rather than to instances of the class.  
40. strictfp — Ensures floating-point calculations are portable and consistent across platforms.  
41. super — Refers to the immediate superclass; used to call superclass constructors or methods.  
42. switch — Performs multi-way branching based on the value of an expression.  
43. synchronized — Ensures that only one thread can execute a block or method at a time.  
44. this — Refers to the current instance of the class.  
45. throw — Explicitly throws an exception object.  
46. throws — Declares the checked exceptions that a method might throw.  
47. transient — Prevents a field from being serialized when an object is written to a stream.  
48. try — Defines a block where exceptions might occur (used with catch and/or finally).  
49. void — Indicates that a method does not return any value.  
50. volatile — Indicates that a variable’s value may change unexpectedly; prevents certain compiler optimizations.  
51. while — Repeats a block of code as long as a condition remains true.  
52. underscore(_) — Not used in Java (reserved for future use). 
53. module — Declares a module (used in module-info.java files for the Java Platform Module System). 
54. open — Used in module declarations (Java 9+). 
55. opens — Used in module declarations (Java 9+).  
56. requires — Used in module declarations (Java 9+). 
57. to — Used in module declarations (Java 9+).
