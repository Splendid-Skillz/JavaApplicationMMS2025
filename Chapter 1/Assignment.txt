Execise 1.7 
Explain the two compilation phases of Java programs. 

Java programs go through two compilation phases:

1. Compilation Phase (javac):
The Java compiler translates the source code (.java file) into bytecode (.class file).

2. Interpretation/Execution Phase (JVM):
The Java Virtual Machine interprets or just-in-time (JIT) compiles the bytecode into machine language so it can run on the computer.


Exercise 1.8 
One of the world’s most common objects is a wrist watch. Discuss how each of the following terms and concepts applies to the notion of a watch: object, attributes, behaviors, class, inheritance (consider, for example, an alarm clock), modeling, messages, encapsulation, interface and information hiding.

Object-Oriented Concepts Applied to a Wristwatch

Object: A specific wristwatch.

Attributes: Color, size, brand, battery level, time displayed.

Behaviors: Display time, set alarm, start/stop stopwatch.

Class: The blueprint called “Watch.”

Inheritance: An alarm clock or smartwatch can inherit from a general clock/watch class and add extra features.

Modeling: Designing a software representation of the watch.

Messages: Pressing buttons sends requests such as setTime() or activateAlarm().

Encapsulation: Internal components (gears, circuits) are hidden from the user.

Interface: Buttons and display screen used to interact with the watch.

Information Hiding: The internal implementation details are not visible to the user.


Making a Difference
Exercise 1.9 (Test-Drive: Carbon Footprint Calculator) 
Some scientists believe that carbon emissions, especially from the burning of fossil fuels, contribute significantly to global warming and that this can be combatted if individuals take steps to limit their use of carbon-based fuels. Organizations and individuals are increasingly concerned about their “carbon footprints.” Websites such as TerraPass http://www.terrapass.com/carbon-footprint-calculator/ and Carbon Footprint http://www.carbonfootprint.com/calculator.aspx provide carbon-footprint calculators. Test-drive these calculators to determine your carbon footprint. Exercises in later chapters will ask you to program your own carbon-footprint calculator. To prepare for this, use the web to research the formulas for calculating carbon footprints. 

Carbon footprint is calculated using the formula:

Carbon Emissions = Activity Data × Emission Factor

Examples:

Fuel consumption × emission factor

Electricity usage (kWh × emission factor)

Air travel miles × emission factor

Results are typically measured in kilograms or tons of CO₂ per year.


Exercise 1.10 (Test-Drive: Body Mass Index Calculator) 
Obesity causes significant increases in illnesses such as diabetes and heart disease. To determine whether a person is overweight or obese, you can use a measure called the body mass index (BMI). The United States Department of Health and Human Services provides a BMI calculator at http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/guidelines/obesity/BMI/ bmicalc.htm. Use it to calculate your own BMI. A forthcoming exercise will ask you to program your own BMI calculator. To prepare for this, use the web to research the formulas for calculating BMI. 

Metric Formula:

B M I = weight(kg)/height(m)^2

Imperial Formula:(For pounds and inches)

B M I = weight(lb) × 703/height(in)^2
	​
BMI Categories:

Underweight: Below 18.5

Normal weight: 18.5 – 24.9

Overweight: 25 – 29.9

Obese: 30 and above


Exercise 1.11 (Attributes of Hybrid Vehicles) 
Hybrid vehicles are becoming increasingly popular, because they often get much better mileage than purely gasoline-powered vehicles. Browse the web and study the features of four or five of today’s popular hybrid cars, then list as many of their hybrid-related attributes as you can. Some common attributes include city-miles-per-gallon and highway-miles-per-gallon. Also list the attributes of the batteries (type, weight, etc.). 


Hybrid-related attributes include:

1. City MPG

2. Highway MPG

3. Combined MPG

4. Battery type (Lithium-ion, Nickel-metal hydride)

5. Battery capacity (kWh)

6. Battery weight

7. Electric motor power

8. Regenerative braking capability

9. CO₂ emissions

10.Fuel tank capacity

11.Charging time (for plug-in hybrids)


Exercise 1.12 (Gender Neutrality) 
Many people want to eliminate sexism in all forms of communication. You’ve been asked to create a program that can process a paragraph of text and replace gender-specific words with gender-neutral ones. Assuming that you’ve been given a list of gender-specific words and their gender-neutral replacements (e.g., replace both “wife” and “husband” with “spouse,” “man” and “woman” with “person,” “daughter” and “son” with “child”), explain the procedure you’d use to read through a paragraph of text and manually perform these replacements. How might your procedure generate a strange term like “woperchild?” You’ll soon learn that a more formal term for “procedure” is “algorithm,” and that an algorithm specifies the steps to be performed and the order in which to perform them. We’ll show how to develop algorithms then convert them to Java programs which can be run on computers.


Procedure:

1. Read the paragraph word by word.

2. Compare each word with a list of gender-specific words.

3. If a match is found, replace it with the gender-neutral equivalent.

4. Continue until the end of the paragraph.


A strange term like “woperchild” might occur if:

“woman” is replaced with “person”

“daughter” is replaced with “child”

Overlapping replacements occur inside already modified words (e.g., replacing “man” inside “woman” without careful boundary checking).


To avoid this, replacements should:

Be done word-by-word (not substring-by-substring).

Use proper word boundaries.
